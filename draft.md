## ARTICLE II: Membership & Volunteer Structure

### Meetings

1. All management decisions for Project Ambri are to be made by the Collective in accordance with the decision making structure outlined in this document.
2.  The Collective will meet in a timely and regular fashion. 
3.  Members must remember that they have a responsibility to attend meetings of the Collective on a regular basis.  
4.  The quarterly meetings of the Members shall be held on the second Thursday in the months of January, April, July and October in each year, beginning with the year 2018, at 7:00 pm, to discuss budgeting and the overall financial situation of the business  in addition to any business as may come before the meeting.
5. Members may designate any place within a ten mile radius of the City of Seattle, as the place of meeting for any quarterly.  If no designation is made, or if a special meeting is otherwise called, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the organization in the City of Seattle, Washington.
6. Written, printed, electronic notice stating the place, day, hour, and purpose or purposes of the meeting for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than 14 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the president, or the secretary, or the officer or persons calling the meeting, to each member of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered, when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the member at his address as it appears on the membership application, with postage thereon prepaid.
7.	Quorum: No less than fifteen of the outstanding Members of the organization entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Members. If less than a quorum of the members entitled to vote is represented at a meeting, a majority of the members so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, no business may be decided upon that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. The Members present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Members to leave less than a quorum. (See Amendment #3)
8. Special meetings of the Members, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute, may be called by no less than five of all the outstanding members of the organization entitled to vote at the meeting and must be signed and delivered to the Executive Director at least 24 hours prior to that meeting.  
9. A special meeting as called by the members may be located within or without the State of Washington as chosen by the members
10. To constitute a decision among the members, a 2/3 vote must be accomplished in which a Quorum is present.
11. At all meetings of Members, a Member may vote by proxy executed in writing by the Member or by his duly authorized attorney in fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the organization before or at the time of the meeting. No proxy shall be valid after 30 days from the date of its execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy.

7. Any decision to be made that affects the bylaws, membership, mission, formation and dissolution of committees, location or time of regular meetings, or any other major decision must be made during a meeting in which at least two-thirds of the membership is present. Such decisions will be announced a week in advance. Emergency meetings can be called with two thirds of the Collective present.
5.  All other decisions must be made at a meeting where at least one
    half of the collective membership is in attendance.
6.  In the event that the meeting does not yield a consensus on an
    issue, a vote may be made where at least three-fourths of the
    collective members present must agree.
7.  Quorum Exemptions
    1.  Quorum is calculated from the number of collective members that
        have actively participated in at least one general meeting in
        the four weeks preceding the decision or are in attendance at
        the meeting for which quorum is being calculated.
    2.  Individual members can exempt themselves from quorum without
        going on a leave of absence by communicating this to the
        collective. (That is to say, if an active member knows that a
        decision will need to be made at a meeting and fears that
        her/his absence might undermine quorum, that member can inform
        the collective that her/his absence should not be counted
        against quorum.)
    3.  Collective members must remember that they have a responsibility
        to attend meetings of the Collective on a regular basis.

8.  Absence from meetings and decision-making
    1.  There will be no proxy voting.
    2.  If a member, who has attended at least 2 of the previous 4
        general meetings, is not able to attend a meeting where major
        decisions are being made, the member is encouraged to either
        exempt themselves from quorum or strongly request that the
        collective postpone the decision until the member can
        participate.
		
### Membership

1.  Any person is eligible to become a member of this Collective,
    provided the following conditions are met:
2.  Collective Membership is voluntary, and is based on approval by the
    existing Collective. Prospective members must agree to work within
    the existing by-laws of the Collective.
3.  All Project Ambri documents, meetings, and meeting notes,
    and other operating agreements are open to scrutiny by any
    Collective member.
5.  The prospective member must fulfill the following requirements
    before the Collective may decide on admission:
    1.  The prospective member must join The Industrial Workers of the
        World, or whatever union currently represents the workers.
    2.  The prospective member must receive training in the store’s
        operation during this period.
    3.  The prospective member shall agree to follow the terms of this
        document, and the Red Emma’s Workers Handbook.

6.  Collective members shall:
    1.  Actively contribute to production, administration or operations
        of the Collective.
    2.  Attend, or make a good faith effort to attend, monthly full
        collective meetings.
    3.  Be committed to collective process, including, but not limited
        to consensus-based decision-making and the maintaining of an
        egalitarian work place.
    4.  Operate the coffeehouse and bookstore in a manner that serves to
        support the maintenance of existing Collective projects.
    5.  Maintain a community space that provides educational material
        and events in accordance with the goals of the Collective.
    6.  Work a minimum number of hours of 20 hours per month in one of
        the Collective’s projects.

7.  Every active worker-owner at Red Emma’s is an equal member of the
    LLC, with an equal voice in the business. Departments determine who
    counts as active, but the Collective/LLC as a whole can override
    these determinations. Good faith attendance at monthly
    full-collective meetings will be a prerequisite of active
    membership.
8.  A member may take a leave of absence from the collective during
    which time the above responsibilities and privileges shall not
    remain in force. Upon reinstatement by the Collective, the member’s
    responsibilities and privileges resume.
9.  Collective members which meet the above requirements are termed
    active members. Collective members who do not meet the above
    requirements(to be reviewed on a quarterly basis) are to be
    considered inactive members. An inactive member loses the ability to
    block decisions, to count against quorum, and to participate in
    voting, but still retains access to the store, is welcome at closed
    meetings of the collective, and counts as a “full collective member”
    for the purposes of scheduling. Inactive members may be reinstated
    as active by the decision of the Collective.
10. Any member may be expelled by the membership for deliberate or
    repeated conduct deemed by the membership to be detrimental to the
    Collective. The member to be expelled must be present at the meeting
    where the expulsion is decided, and shall have an opportunity to
    dispute the charges. While the collective member’s membership is in
    question, the Collective may suspend the rights of the member in
    question to work, volunteer, vote, and act as or claim to be a
    member of the Collective until said member attends a meeting. An
    expelled member may appeal expulsion. Such appeal shall be voted on
    by the membership, following an opportunity for the expelled member
    to be heard, orally or in writing, at the meeting.
11. The Collective maintains the right to hold individual collective
    members, prospective collective members, or other non-member employees personally liable for
    financial losses or damage to assets deemed by the Collective to
    have resulted from grossly negligent or malicious behavior on the
    part of said individuals. Such a decision falls under the procedure
    for “major decisions” in section 2.2.

### Member’s capital

1.  As business capital, the members acknowledge that the money in
    their capital account is at risk; in particular, other creditors
    external to the LLC may have claims on the assets of the LLC whose
    priority is greater than the claims of members. At the same time,
    the principle of limited liability insures that no member will be,
    at any time, liable for more than what they have invested in their
    member capital account.
2.  Members determined to be inactive can—and should—leave their
    capital share of the business in the hands of the LLC if they intend
    to become active again.
3.  Member shares
    1.  When a new member is added to the LLC, that member will
        contribute member capital in the amount of $1,000 . This equity
        remains the property of the member, and forms the basis of their
        member capital account.
    2.  If a member is not able to or would prefer not to invest the
        $1,000 share immediately, the LLC will advance the member a
        loan equal to that amount, with zero interest, to be repaid by a
        minimum automatic deduction of 50 cents/hour from their pay,
        with no fixed term of repayment, such that a full-time, 40
        hr/week worker-owner and LLC member will have repaid said loan
        in 50 weeks. Members may also pay a portion of their $1,000
        share up front, and pay the remaining funds through an automatic
        deduction.
    3.  Member shares represent an important commitment to the LLC and
        a sign of personal investment in the workplace and in the
        mission of the LLC. As such, the contribution of this $1,000
        share is distinct from any retained earnings allocated to the
        member.

4.  Capital Accounts
    1.  A member’s capital account represents the amount of investment
        made by the member in the business. It is money that belongs to
        them, but which they are allowing the business to use.
    2.  An amount equal to no less than one quarter of the total
        amount of member capital, in cash or other liquid assets, will,
        barring exceptional circumstances, be retained on hand by the
        LLC.
    3.  The amount recorded in a member capital account grows when:
        1.  The member “buys their share” in the LLC.
        2.  The member is allocated a patronage refund at the end of
            the fiscal year, and the LLC, operating on a cooperative
            basis, retains up to 80% of this refund as allowed by law,
            recording this retention in the member’s capital account.
        3.  The member makes a loan of personal capital to the LLC.
        4.  The member elects to have a portion of their wages
            retained by the LLC .

    4.  The amount recorded in a member capital account decreases
        when:
        1.  The LLC elects to pay back a loan of personal capital made
            by the member.
        2.  The member elects to receive back wages they have
            previously elected to retain in their capital account.
        3.  The LLC elects to distribute some portion of retained
            patronage refunds. 
        4.  The LLC allocates, at the end of the fiscal year, a
            member’s share of any loss incurred in that year, in
            proportion to the member’s share of the total held in all
            capital accounts. The LLC has the option of whether such
            allocations reduce the current balance in the member’s
            account, or merely reduce any future allocations of profit.
            Additionally, the capital corresponding to a) member shares
            and b) any loans from the member to LLC should not be
            reduced by a share of operating losses.
	5.  The member decides to take a cash distribution against the
	    balance of their capital account. Such distributions to
	    must not exceed a total of $500 to a given LLC member in a
	    given calendar year, and must not result in a balance of
	    less than $1,000 in the member's capital account.

    5.  Records of member capital accounts will be available on a
        quarterly basis for inspection by all active members of the
        LLC.



5.  Loans to collective members
    1.  Members may choose to borrow against their member capital
        account, with the total amount advanced in this fashion not to
        exceed 1/2 of the recorded balance. Such loans must be approved
        by the LLC before being dispersed. Loans to members in other
        amounts, or against other assets of the LLC, are strongly
        discouraged.

6.  Member capital and departing members
    1.  Upon a voluntary or involuntary exit from the LLC, the member
        will receive the amount accumulated in their capital account,
        less any outstanding debts of the member to the LLC, and less
        any damages incurred by the LLC and directly attributable, as
        determined by the LLC, to the actions of the member. Such
        payment will be made by the LLC no more than six months after
        their relationship with the LLC has been severed. The exact
        schedule of repayment is to be determined by the LLC.

    2. Members exiting voluntarily from the LLC may elect to leave the
       balance of their capital account with the LLC through the end
       of the fiscal year, with the LLC paying said balance back up to
       six months after the end of that fiscal year, in order to
       remain eligible for any shares of profit or loss to be
       allocated at the end of the fiscal year, as specified in 7.1
       below.  Members who choose to request the balance of their
       capital account upon their departure from the project and not
       at the end of the fiscal year, and members whose departure from
       the project is not voluntary, are not eligible to receive
       allocations of profit and loss at the end of the fiscal year in
       which they departed.

7.  Allocation of profit and loss
    1.  All profit will be passed through for tax purposes to LLC
        members in proportion to the amount of hours worked in the
        previous fiscal year. All loss will be passed through for tax
        purposes to LLC members in proportion to the share of the total
        capital accounts held by the member.

## ARTICLE III: Paid employees

### Wages

1.  The Red Emma’s minimum wage is $11/hr.
    “Base wages” will be defined as the Red Emma’s “minimum” wage
    rate/hour, plus 50% of any additional hourly wage. “Surplus wages”
    will be defined as the remaining 50%.
2.  Base wages will be paid every two weeks in a timely fashion.
    Surplus wages will be paid on a quarterly basis, but only after a
    determination by the LLC that the business was and will continue to
    be sufficiently profitable to make this distribution of wages to
    members a wise decision.
3.  The hourly wage rate will, at the discretion of the LLC, and on an
    annual basis, be adjusted upwards , when the LL elects to:
    1.  raise the base wage of every worker-owner
    2.  establish a raise for current and future worker-owners based
        on the length of time they have been members of the LLC
    3.  establish a raise for current and future worker-owners based
        on the total number of hours they have worked to date

4.  However, at no point is the LLC allowed to raise wages such that
    the difference between the highest paid and lowest paid member
    exceeds a 2:1 ratio.
5.  Additionally, the LLC may elect to give one-time bonuses to all
    members, either in equal amounts or based on the amount of hours
    worked in a given period. Such bonuses should reflect anticipated
    surpluses, but do not need to wait for the final determination of
    profit/loss at the end of the fiscal year. Such bonuses should be
    treated, for tax purposes, as extra wages.
6.  In the event that the business enters a period of temporary
    financial distress, Red Emma’s worker-owners have the option of
    allowing their wages to accumulate in their capital accounts, rather
    than being distributed to them in cash. It is encouraged that no
    wages retained in this way remain in the member’s capital account
    for any period longer than one year.

### Hiring

1.  Hiring takes place either:
    1.  When a department cannot fill allocated hours from within the
        current collective
    2.  When a department receives an allocation of additional paid
        hours from the full collective at a quarterly budgeting meeting,
        or in exceptional circumstances, at a monthly meeting.

2.  The hiring process will be as follows:
    1.  The department forms a hiring committee
    2.  The department can solicit applicants in whatever way makes
        sense to them. This could be very informal, or involve a
        publicly advertised position
    3.  After narrowing down the candidates to people who they feel
        should get an interview:
        1.  The names of those candidates are circulated to the full
            collective; there is a three day window before any interview
            can take place in case someone has a blocking concern
        2.  A person from outside the hiring department, selected by
            the advisory council, joins the hiring committee and takes
            part in the interviews and selection of person to be
            hired.

    4.  Once a candidate has been selected:
        1.  The candidate can start paid work immediately in a
            probationary period, as an employee of Red Emma's.
        2.  After at least 1 month + 20 hrs of work, after a
            departmental review, the new hire is interviewed by the full
            collective at a monthly collective meeting.
        3.  If the full collective approves the hire, they become a
            prospective collective member.  A prospective collective member remains an employee of Red Emma's, but may enjoy additional privileges and responsibilities as outlined elsewhere in these by-laws.

    5.  After three months:
        1.  There is another departmental review.

    6.  After six months as a prospective collective member:
        1.  After a final departmental review, the full collective
            reviews the new hire, and if there are no blocking concerns,
            the prospective member is added to the LLC as a member and becomes a collective member.
	2.  If either the department or the full collective determines
   	    the new hire is not ready for collective membership at six
   	    months, the process may be extended for up to an
   	    additional six months, with a final review at both levels
   	    necessary before become a member of the LLC and
   	    collective.

    8.  All reviews are recorded and kept on file, and are geared to
        provide a standardized formula for evaluation.
    9.  The existence of scheduled reviews by a department or the full
        collective do not preclude termination for gross incompetence or
        malicious behavior.

### Firing

1.  Department- vs. Collective-level Firing
    1.  Firing may be initiated at the department level or at the
        collective level. Firing is initiated at the department level in
        instances of incompetence, unprofessionalism, or general “bad
        fit”.
    2.  Firing at the collective level is reserved for behavior
        sufficiently transgressive or destructive that it substantially
        impacts members of departments other than the department of the
        worker in the firing process.

2.  Department level firing:
    1.  Departments are mandated to develop written internal standards
        for competence and professionalism specific to the work of the
        department and make these standards available to collective
        members and new hires. It is the role of the department to
        assess if a department member is adhering to these standards.
    2.  Departments will develop internal procedures for initiating
        firing and providing process to department members. No worker
        will be fired by a department without first being given the
        opportunity to discuss specific problems in their performance
        with the department. The intent of these discussions is to help
        the worker in question to improve their performance.
    3.  As an intermediate step or an alternative to firing,
        departments may establish special benchmarks for individual
        workers meant to re-establish confidence in the good faith
        and/or competence of the department member . Departments are
        encouraged to develop a routine performance review process for
        department members.
    4.  Notes from any firing procedures, as well performance reviews,
        and the details of any special benchmarks set for workers must
        be stored in a file in the Red Emma’s office and be available to
        any members of the collective. All of these documents must be
        reviewed and signed by the department members participating in
        the process including the worker under review, and the member
        under review is invited to attach their own explanatory notes .
        In the instance of firing due to consistent lateness or absence
        for shifts, individual instances of lateness or absence must be
        documented.
    5.  It is the policy of Red Emma’s that workers will not work in
        the store while intoxicated and repeated breach of this policy
        may result in firing.

3.  Collective-level firing:
    1.  A workeer who is alleged by another worker to have performed
        one of the following acts is banned from the store immediately
        and until an emergency closed collective meeting can be held:
        sexual or other physical assault on a collective member or other
        space-user, theft or malicious destruction of collective
        property or property on the premises, clandestine collaboration with law enforcement or
        intelligence services, and illegally using or distributing drugs
        in or around the store. Failure to observe this ban will result
        in firing.
    2.  The purpose of the emergency meeting is to determine the
        factual circumstances of the event and the appropriate
        collective response up to and including firing and banning.
    3.  All decisions at these emergency meetings are treated as major
        decisions.
    4.  Other forms of obnoxious, harassing, or abusive behavior will
        be addressed through the Red Emma’s grievance procedure, with
        firing as a possible outcome.

4.  Logistics of Firing:
    1.  A collective member who no longer has membership in any
        department due to firing will be treated for all other purposes
        like a collective member who has voluntarily left the
        collective.
    2.  When a worker is fired at the collective level, all issues
        related to keys, passwords, and the disbursement of shares will
        be determined by the collective on a case-by-case basis.

### Employees who are not collective members

1.  As necessary, departments may decide to hire workers who do not
    intend to become members of the collective, pursuant to the approval
    of the collective as stipulated in “Hiring”
2.  Because we value a democratic workplace, such workers are
    understood to either be filling a temporary need that is limited in
    duration, or contributing in a strictly delimited part-time manner
    to the operations of the business. Non collective members should
    either:
    1.  Work one year or less in the project *or*
    2.  Work eight hours or less per week, averaged on a quarterly
        basis, in the project

    collective membership, and should not remain employed if they exceed
    the above limits but the collective declines to extend an offer of
    membership.
4.  Because we value an egalitarian workplace, such workers shall not
    be paid an hourly wage less than the lowest paid member of the
    collective.

### Grievance Procedure

1.  Collective members and prospective collective members can present
    grievances against individuals or the Collective as a whole to the
    Collective during regular meetings. Such grievances will be
    considered priority agenda items.
2.  If the intent of presenting a grievance is to seek mediation or
    intervention from the Collective in redress of the grievance, it
    should be treated as a major decision as outlined in section 2.2.
3.  It is within the rights of the person presenting a grievance to
    request that the meeting (or portion of a meeting) in which the
    grievance will be aired be closed to all but full collective
    members. If the grievance involves individual collective members or
    prospective members, the individuals airing the grievance may
    request that the meeting (or relevant portion of the meeting) be
    closed to the individuals against whom the grievance was made. These
    individuals also have the right to request that they have an
    opportunity to meet with the Collective without the presence of the
    individuals who originally brought forth the grievance. No decisions
    may be made by the collective regarding the grievance without both
    parties involved being given the opportunity to return to the
    meeting.
4.  If a meeting has been closed in accordance with 6.3, the collective
    can decide to reopen the meeting in order to pursue
    resolution/redress or to continue discussing the grievance.
5.  The collective may seek outside mediation if it is unable to
    successfully resolve a grievance.
